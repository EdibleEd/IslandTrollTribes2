Buildings can't pick up items
>toxic: make the buildings a hero with no turn speed and no move speed

[ISSUE]
No obvious way to give items a max stack count, especially important for meat 
>toxic: make items "meat (1)" through "meat (10)" and write up crafting combinations for each possibility

[ISSUE]
It's possible to build buildings on top of neutrals, blocking them from moving
>toxic: make buildings when constructed launch a check on every neutral in the game, if the neutral is within the build radius of the building it is
>teleported away from the building by a minimum of the radius of the building in the degree that it was facing from the building's center

[ISSUE]
Shops can't be tied to npcs, so currently there is a purely vosmetic unit representing a shop, and a stumpy courier following that is the actual shop
>toxic: not really an issue, if possible make selecting the cosmetic unit actually select the couier and make the courier completely transparent

[ISSUE]
Shops are always shown on the minimap
>toxic: change the icon that's used to represent shops to something completely transparent

[ISSUE]
No way to signal the minimap? I've looked in actions, API functions, dota events, no luck.
Necessary for item and enemy radar.
>toxic: have ITT send to flash the posx, posy, and color of the ping, create a function in flash to create templated objects that look like pings at that location relative
>to the bottom left corner of the screen, if the minimap is different for different resolutions add a scalar factor for each resolution
